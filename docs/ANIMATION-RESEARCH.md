# Famous animations, and which ones to predraw

A survey of iconic animations from the games my-3D2dge exists to remake (NES to PS1/N64, plus a few modern retro references), grouped by the engine's views and genres. For each one it notes what the engine can already do. It ends with a list of animations worth shipping ready-made, so a model can ask for them by name instead of animating them by hand.

The research ran in five sweeps: side view, brawler and fighting, three-quarter and top-down, isometric and 3D-era, and JRPG battles plus shoot-'em-ups. Sources are linked in each row. Frame counts come from code wherever possible: the published *Prince of Persia* source, the *Zelda 1* and *Pokémon Red* disassemblies, the *A Link to the Past* and *Super Mario 64* decompilations, the DevilutionX data tables for *Diablo*, and the Sonic Physics Guide. "f" means one frame at 60 fps unless a row says otherwise. Where no source gave a number, none is given.

## 1. What "predrawn" means here

The engine draws everything with code and animates from continuous values, never frame lists, so "predrawn" does not mean sprite sheets. It means an animation that ships **named, timed and tuned**, the way `E.MOVES` does for attacks:

- a model asks for it in one line (`new E.Attack('hadouken')`, `pose: 'carry'`, `E.act(rig, 'getup')`, `E.fx.death(actor, 'dissolve')`);
- it has anticipation, a committed action, follow-through and a clean return built in;
- it works on every build (chibi, heroic, bulky, skeleton) and in every view;
- a model can't easily get it wrong, because timing and body motion are already solved.

An animation is worth predrawing when:
- many genres need it;
- it's hard to author by hand (many joints moving in sequence, IK, whole-body rotation, cloth, a timed chain of states);
- or getting it wrong is what makes a remake look like an NES game instead of a PS1 one.

## 2. What the engine draws today

Legend used in the rest of this document:
- ✅ in the engine, one call away;
- 🟡 partly there: close enough to compose, or built in a game or slice but not in the engine;
- ❌ missing.

### In the engine (`engine/my-3d2dge.js`)

| Area | What ships | How a game asks for it |
|---|---|---|
| Locomotion | idle (breathing, weight shift, blinks), walk and run gaits driven by velocity (strafe and backpedal included), dash lean, one airborne tuck, crouch, ladder climb hand over hand, run in place | `rig.update(dt, { vx, vy, dash, air, climb, vz, run })` |
| Attacks (24 in `E.MOVES`) | **blades:** slash, backslash, overhead, rising, thrust, spin, plunge, twohand. **fists:** jab, cross, hook, uppercut, haymaker, elbow. **kicks:** kick, roundhouse, sweep, flyingkick, knee, axekick. **other:** cast, throw, bash, claw | `new E.Attack(name)`, `new E.Combo([...])`, `E.move(name, u)` |
| Held poses (10) | cheer, cast, guard, block, kneel, crouch, wave, hips, down, die | `pose: '...'`, `down: 0..1` |
| Stances | guard (fists up while walking), ready (weapon forward) | `stance: '...'` |
| Reactions | one hurt flinch, knocked flat, die (stagger, knees, topple), squash and stretch | `hurt`, `down`, `pose: 'die'`, `rig.kick(v)` |
| Guns | point, aim up and down | `point`, `aim` |
| Faces | smile, shout, angry, wince; blinks; talking portraits | `expr`, `drawPortrait` |
| Secondary motion | capes, long hair and ponytails, weapon trails, afterimages | automatic, `drawSmear`, `r.actor(..., { ghost })` |
| Blob | squash, look, squint, hop-walk, bat wings (flap, fold), roost upside down | `blob.update(dt, {...})` |
| Effects | dust, sparks, bits, rings, smoke, fire, impact stars, glints, explosions, damage numbers; hit-stop, shake, flash, slow motion | `game.particles.*`, `game.hitFx` |
| Transitions | a fade through black between scenes; camera slides from room to room | `game.go`, `cam.room` |

A filmstrip of the animation lab's jump (`node tools/filmstrip.mjs dist/my-3d2dge.html#animlab ...`) shows the gap in the airborne pose: the same tuck holds from take-off to landing. There are no separate rise, apex and fall poses.

### Built in game code, not in the engine yet

These already work. Moving them into the engine is the cheapest way to add animations.

| Animation | Where it lives | Technique |
|---|---|---|
| Dodge roll (a full forward somersault; the cloth whips round) | `src/emberdeep/20-hero.js` `heroRoll` | turns every joint around the hips after `rig.update` |
| Drink a potion while moving | `src/emberdeep/20-hero.js` `heroDrinkPose` | re-solves the free arm with `E.ik3` |
| Wounded: hand pressed to the side | `src/emberdeep/20-hero.js` `heroWoundPose` | IK arm layer |
| Level-up aura, perfect-dodge slow motion | `src/emberdeep/20-hero.js` | particles and time scale |
| Launched and juggled, then a bounce | `src/emberdeep/30-monsters-core.js` | ballistic arc, `hurt` + `air`, bounce on landing |
| Frozen foes shatter | `src/emberdeep/46-mechanics-a.js` | shards, no corpse |
| Skeleton rises from a bone heap; falls apart into bones | `src/starter/20-platformer.js` | `down` → `kneel` → stand; debris |
| Collar grab → knee → knee → elbow | `src/starter/50-brawler.js` | a custom `GRAB` spec in an `E.Combo` |
| Knocked down, get up on one knee, blink while safe | `src/starter/50-brawler.js`, animation lab | `down` → `kneel` → stand |
| Jump squat, air, landing squash | animation lab | `crouch` + `air` + `kick` |
| JRPG approaches: dash, leap, swoop, hop, step in, flee; potion held up; party runs in, foes fade in | `src/starter/40-rpg.js` | per-move `go` field |
| Craft that bank and roll; jets flying single file on the leader's path | `src/starter/30-shooter.js` | vector craft in a local frame; path following |
| Townsfolk at work: hammer at an anvil, pump bellows, wipe brow, float cross-legged and read, count coins, sweep, patrol with a lantern, kneel and pray | `src/emberdeep/56-town.js` | a step machine, IK arms, held props |
| Crawler (8 IK legs), serpent (path-following segments; burrows and surfaces), watcher (floating eye with tendrils) | `src/emberdeep/33-beasts.js` | new rigs, posed in 3D, projected with `view.p` |

**One structural gap stands out.** `E.MOVES` packages *attacks* (wind, strike, recover), but nothing packages the non-attack animations that are several beats long: knocked down → sit up → kneel → stand, lift → carry, item held up, ledge hang → climb up, roll. The animation lab and each slice rebuild these as private phase lists (`[label, seconds, rigState]`). A shared `E.ACTIONS` library, played by one call, is what would turn most of the list below into one-liners.

### 3.5 JRPG battles (brawler or side view)

| Animation | Game | What happens | Engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step in, strike, step back | [Final Fantasy IV-VI](https://www.ff6hacking.com/wiki/doku.php?id=ff3%3Aff3us%3Atutorial%3Asprites) | The active hero steps out of line, walks up, swings, and walks back. FF6 stores 17 animations and 46 poses per character. | 🟡 RPG slice |
| Critical kneel, KO | [Final Fantasy VI](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/HP_Critical) | Below 1/8 HP the hero kneels (and may unleash a desperation attack); KO lies flat. | ✅ `kneel`, `down` |
| Cast with an aura | [Final Fantasy IV-VI](https://guides.gamercorner.net/ffvi/spells/) | Step forward, raise the arms, a glow colored by the school of magic, then the effect on the target. A summon dims the screen. | 🟡 `cast`; no aura preset |
| Victory pose with the fanfare | [Final Fantasy VII](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_victory_poses) | Cloud pumps his fist twice, twirls the sword and slings it on his back; each hero has their own. | 🟡 `cheer`; the victory song ✅ |
| Enemy death fade | [Final Fantasy](https://tropedia.fandom.com/wiki/Everything_Fades) | Enemies fade out in a purple haze; bosses get longer deaths. | ❌ |
| Front-view feedback | [Dragon Quest](https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest) | Monsters only blink when hit; the screen shakes when the party is hit; the dead vanish. | ✅ `flash`, shake |
| Escape | [Final Fantasy](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_(command)) | The party turns and runs off; in FF VI each member leaves at a different moment. | ✅ `run` in place |

| Hyper, bullet cancel | [DoDonPachi DaiOuJou](https://shmups.wiki/library/DoDonPachi_DaiOuJou) | A full gauge cancels every bullet into score stars; activation brings brief invincibility. | 🟡 bullets can be cleared by hand |
| Polarity swap | [Ikaruga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga) | One button flips the ship black or white; same-color bullets are absorbed. | ❌ |
| Tank that squashes | [Metal Slug](https://metalslug.fandom.com/wiki/SV-001_(Metal_Slug)) | A rigid tank crouches, jumps and squashes like an animal; it rams and explodes. | ❌ |
| Boss death, respawn | [genre-wide](https://shmups.wiki/library/Help:Glossary) | Chain explosions, a white flash, shake, bullets turned into points, the stage-clear tally; the player flies back in from the bottom, blinking. | 🟡 explosions, flash, shake ✅; no sequence |

## 4. What the research says

1. **About fifteen animations are in every genre.** Take-off and landing, a bored idle, get hurt with a hop and a blink, get knocked down and get up, pick up, carry and throw, hold an item up, open, a victory pose, a charge-up glow, a roll or dodge, a death that suits the cause, an alert "!", and a transition between screens. Every sweep produced its own copy of this list.
2. **The famous ones are transitions and reactions, not loops.** Walk and run cycles are rarely what people remember. The skid, the teeter, the ledge pull-up, the item get, the death spin, the piledriver and the victory pose are all short, multi-beat sequences between two states. That is the category the engine lacks (see the structural gap in section 2).
3. **Timing is anticipation plus a held contact frame.** The ALttP sword holds step 5 of 9; the Castlevania whip hits on tick 17 of 22; Stardew's hoe holds its impact for 170 ms after two 40 ms smears; Diablo marks an "action frame" in every animation. `E.MOVES` already works this way (wind, active, `hitAt`, hold). New moves should keep it.
4. **One death per cause is the modern standard.** Crash (fire, crush, drown, electricity), Diablo III (fire, cold, lightning, poison) and Metal Slug (by weapon) all do it. A small library of death styles that works on any rig or sprite makes a remake read as PS1 rather than NES.
5. **State shows on the body.** Madeline's hair shows dashes left; Resident Evil's heroes clutch their side, then limp; Final Fantasy's heroes kneel at critical HP; Mario pants at low health and shivers in snow. A rig input for condition (`hurtLevel`, `cold`, `tired`) gives every game this for free.
6. **Procedural rigs get reuse for free.** Prince of Persia plays its climb backwards to climb down, and Aladdin stretched its budget with holds, loops and flips. A rig does all of this without extra frames, and one move works in every facing. That is why the whole list below is affordable.
7. **Shadows and height cues matter off the side view.** Landstalker's jumps are notoriously hard to judge; Alundra's constant ground shadow is what makes three-quarter platforming readable. Any jump, hop or throw preset should draw its shadow at ground height.

## 5. What to predraw

Every entry names the famous references, the views and genres it serves, and the likely way to build it in this engine:
- **spec:** a new `E.MOVES` entry;
- **pose:** a held pose in the rig;
- **state:** a rig input driven by physics;
- **action:** a timed sequence of rig states in a new `E.ACTIONS` library;
- **layer:** joints post-processed after `rig.update`, as Emberdeep does;
- **prop:** an object drawn from the hand joints;
- **fx:** an effect preset;
- **rig:** a new rig.

Sizes: S is under a day, M a few days, L a week or more.

## 6. Build order

By value (how many genres use it) over cost:

1. **`E.ACTIONS` and a player for it**, starting with the get-up (2), item get (10), lift and carry (8) and interactions (11). This is the missing layer; most of Tier 1 then becomes a few lines each.
2. **Jump phases** (1). Every game with a jump uses it, and the fix is small.
3. **Hurt variants, knockback hop, blink, dizzy** (3, 5).
4. **The flip layer** (7), promoted from Emberdeep; it unlocks rolls, backflips, somersault and spin jumps, the ground pound (21) and the Dragoon jump (32).
5. **Death styles** (6). The biggest visual jump from NES to PS1 for the least work per game.
6. **Emote bubbles and charge-up** (13, 14). Small, and every genre uses them.
7. **Fighting and beat-'em-up specials as `E.MOVES`** (24), then **grab and victim poses** (25).
8. **Ledge hang and wall slide** (15, 16). The physics is partly there already.
9. **Idle life** (12), promoting the Emberdeep wound layer.
10. **Transitions** (38) and the **path trail** (39).
11. **The ship helper** (37).
12. **New rigs** (34-36).

## 8. Keeping it model-friendly

- **One line in the API card per family, not per animation.** The card is embedded in every single-file edition and in every genre kit. List names the way `E.MOVES` does (`E.ACTIONS: getup itemget lift carry throw open talk read pickup lever door`), with one example call.
- **Everything goes into the animation lab.** It already lists every `E.MOVES` entry by itself; teach it `E.ACTIONS`, the death styles and the transitions, so each new animation can be reviewed on every skin, in every view, at quarter speed.
- **Check each one with a filmstrip** (`tools/filmstrip.mjs`): the anticipation, the committed action, the held contact and a clean return.
- **Judge by eye.** Then have builder models remake one famous scene per genre from a frozen copy of the dist file, and score the screenshots with vision judges against the PS1/N64 bar, as with earlier engine changes.
