/* =============================================================================
 * STRESS TEST, 3D WORLD (temporary lab; docs/LAB-3D.md): the stress test built again from the ground up as a 3D game,
 * not the 2D game drawn in 3D (that is /stress-3d). It tries to do the same things (a torch-lit hall, the hero, a crowd
 * of walkers, slimes and wisps that take turns to attack, waves, a particle storm, the panel, the numbers and the
 * benchmark) the way a 3D game would, and is allowed to feel different:
 *   physics    Rapier 0.19.3 (SIMD): every monster is a rigid body (the crowd pushes and piles up by itself, knockback
 *              is momentum, big hits launch bodies into the air, the fallen fly and slide), the hero is a character
 *              controller that walks, dashes and jumps, crates and barrels are knocked about
 *   world      a hall written as text (10-hall): walls, pillars, low walls to jump, a raised rune dais, two galleries
 *              up stairs; every mesh and texture made by code
 *   shared     the animation system, unchanged: the engine's rigs (E.Humanoid, E.Blob), its moves (E.MOVES,
 *              E.Attack, E.Combo), its particles' emitters and its pixel font; the floor's texture is the 2D hall's own
 *   drawing    three.js r182 (WebGPURenderer: WebGPU, or WebGL 2 by itself); characters as Cards (the engine draws
 *              each rig onto a card) or Puppets (3D parts on the same joints)
 * One coordinate system for the game and the physics: the engine's own units, z up (16 units = 1 metre = one tile),
 * so the rigs, moves and reaches read exactly as in the 2D games. Rapier runs in those units (its length unit is 16,
 * gravity points down z); three.js gets metres, y up, at the drawing's edge (toThree).
 * Parts (one module, joined in name order by tools/build.mjs; they share one scope):
 *   00-setup    imports, units, the renderer, helpers and the materials the parts share
 *   10-hall     the level as ASCII text, its floor heights and walkable grid, colliders, meshes, braziers, lights
 *   20-sim      the game on Rapier: hero, monsters, combat, waves, props, shots, particles; fixed steps, state hash
 *   30-crowd    characters as Cards or Puppets in instanced batches; crates and barrels from their bodies
 *   35-effects  telegraphs, trails, bolts, particles; damage numbers and notes on a pixel overlay
 *   40-cameras  the views (orthographic or perspective), side scrolling with depth, custom, chase, first person, fly,
 *               fixed; what the keys and mouse mean in each
 *   45-filters  Clean, Comic cel or Pixel on the scene, the characters and objects, or the hall; bloom; FXAA
 *   50-frame    the loop (game steps, then one picture), lights, the resolution, the warm-up
 *   60-panel    the panel, the metrics, presets, the benchmark, window.__sw
 * The rules (tools/stress-world-test.mjs checks them, as for the 3D world lab): WebGPURenderer and node materials
 * only, no compute shaders or storage buffers, nothing read back from the GPU into gameplay. Gameplay (20-sim) never
 * reads the renderer: the same inputs give the same state and the same hash on WebGPU, WebGL 2 or no renderer.
