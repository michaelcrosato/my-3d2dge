 * PERFORMANCE GOVERNOR: keeps the game fluid on slower machines. When the frame rate stays low it drops the
 * outlines on ordinary monsters, caps particles and lets glows draw over what stands in front of them (the renderer's
 * glow mask, canvas lighting only); when there is headroom again it brings them back.
 * PERF.low is read by drawFoe (30-monsters-core.js). Settings > Particles still sets the ceiling.
 * It samples on the wall clock (slow motion, perfect dodges and 3x bot runs must not skew it): low after 3 s under
 * 45 fps, back after `need` samples at 57+. A machine that drops straight back (within 25 s) waits twice as long next
 * time, so a borderline one settles instead of flickering its outlines on and off. ED.perf exposes it for tools.
