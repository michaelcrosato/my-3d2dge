/* =============================================================================
 * LAB 3D (temporary lab; the plan is docs/LAB-3D.md): our characters in a fully 3D world.
 * three.js r182 (WebGPURenderer: WebGPU, falling back to WebGL 2 by itself) and Rapier 0.19.3 (SIMD), vendored in
 * vendor/ and loaded through the import map in src/lab3d.template.html. The engine (window.My3D2dge), the mocap
 * player (Mocap, window.MOCAP) and Dan's body (window.DanRig) are classic scripts inlined above this module,
 * unchanged; this module only reads them.
 *
 * The parts (joined in name order into one module by tools/build.mjs, so they share one scope; read the headers):
 *   00-setup       imports, units, the address options, small helpers
 *   10-materials   procedural textures (drawn by code, pixel by pixel) and the node materials
 *   20-world       the room from its ASCII map: walls, pillars, floor, crates' meshes, torches, the sun
 *   30-physics     Rapier: colliders from the same map, crates, the hero's controller, the fixed step, the hash
 *   40-characters  the cast (hero, mocap figure, Dan): Card mode (the engine draws) and Puppet mode (3D parts)
 *   50-cameras     the engine's five fixed views (with its height boost), orbit, fly, chase, fix
 *   60-panel       the render loop, the look options, the panel and keys, window.__lab3d
 *
 * Coordinates. three.js is y-up, in metres. The engine is z-up in its own units: 16 units = 1 metre = 1 floor tile.
 *   engine (x, y, z)  <->  three (x / U, z / U, y / U)          (toThree / toEngine below)
 *   an engine angle a (facing, yaw) turns about three's y axis by -a
 * The rules (tools/lab3d-test.mjs checks them): WebGPURenderer and node materials only (never WebGLRenderer,
 * ShaderMaterial, onBeforeCompile, EffectComposer); no compute shaders or storage buffers (WebGPU-only); nothing read
 * back from the GPU into gameplay. Gameplay (30-physics) runs on the CPU at a fixed 60 Hz and never reads the renderer.
